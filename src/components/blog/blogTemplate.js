    simple blog template.
    this template can be copied and pasted on this folder to create a new one and we can simply use the gatsbyjs ability to use things such as <Layout> to create a new blog page.
    the top of the article will have the name of the author and the date.
    underneath that will be the title of the blog.
    underneath that will be the blog itself:
        it will have a small paragraph used to hook the reader, a thesis if you will
        a picture will follow that paragraph
        about two or three paragraphs will follow this picture
        there will be an opportunity to upload picture and showcase them right after the paragraphs
        there will be a conclusion paragraph
        there will be more pictures and thank you section that will thank members, parents, sponsors and such
