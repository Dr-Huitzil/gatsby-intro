         i want this page to have a grid. three columns and as many rows necessary. 
         there is a dedicated amount of space for a picture, the date, the title of the blog and a small summary.
          when you click on the blog, it will take you to a new page with the full blog.
          i want to be able to copy and paste the template and have it automatically add a new row to the grid.
